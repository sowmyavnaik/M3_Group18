# Remote keyless entry (RKE) 

## Description
* Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles. It requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver. RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally. RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams.
